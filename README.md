# Overview

The data set I am analyzing in R is YouTube channel data. It contains the top 100 channels with their respective data such as, rank, subcriber count, and total video views.
The data was sourced from kaggle the link is posted below:

As a software engineer the purpose for writing this software to analyze data is to expand my knowledge of data science. This piece of software was done using the R language in RStudio. This software implements code to clean data, create graphs, measure metrics, and summarizes our data set. I wanted to learn how to organize a large data set and then analyze it for any patterns in R. Ultimately, this software provides the capability to take a data set, clean the raw data to make it useful, and answer important questions that provide future use for data science.

# Data Analysis Results

Which year did the majority of channels in the top 100 start?
The year in which the majority of all channels in the top were created was in 2006.

What is the mean video count for all channels in the top 100 ranking? In other words, what is the average number of videos for channel ranked in the international top 100?
The average number of videos per channel ranked in the top 100 was 15205.
